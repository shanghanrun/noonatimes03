    "summary": "Baron (Keery), a sweet-natured but simple-minded small-town boy is incarcerated. Upon learning that his new cellmate, Otis (Hodge), has an extensive rap sheet including several prison breaks, Baron implores him to help him escape. He states that he needs to get out so that he can meet his girlfriend at an undisclosed spot the following afternoon. Otis is reluctant, stating that he doesn't trust anyone \"not even [his] own damn self\", however Baron promises him $250,000 cash if they are able to escape successfully. Otis agrees to carry out the prison break, but asks how Baron has that much money. Baron begins to tell the story of how he landed in prison.Some time prior to his arrest, Baron is let go from his job at the local post office, which he needs to support his terminally ill mother, Eda, due to his refusal to cut his long hair. Upon returning home, he finds a letter in the mailbox, stating that his mother's medication has increased in price. He informs her of this as he gives her her pills and feeds her a Moon Pie. Despondent, he goes to a local park, where he throws himself to the ground in frustration. A car, driven by an eccentric stranger with pink hair (Morrone), pulls up. The woman states that she thought she'd \"stumbled on a dead body\" and expresses disappointment that Baron is, in fact, alive. She asks Baron if there's anything to do in this \"shit town\", to which he responds that there isn't. She speeds away, but circles back when she sees him smashing a tree branch against the swing set. She teases him for \"flailing around like a puppet\", and he tells her that there are, in fact, things to do in town, including a quarry and an ice cream shop. She introduces herself as Marmalade, and asks him to show her around town.At the quarry, Marmalade and Baron exchange life stories. She tells him that she has been in the foster care system her entire life and he tells her about his mother's sickness. He also tells her that he grew up believing his father was an astronaut who was absent from his childhood because he was building a rocket and who died when said rocket exploded. Marmalade is amused by his naivety, and asks if she can stay with him that night. He takes her home, and the two immediately fall into an intense whirlwind romance.With a lack of income to the home, Baron and Marmalade begin to brainstorm about ways to afford Eda's medication. He suggests that they should rent out the unused bedroom, but Marmalade convinces him that they should rob a bank instead. They construct an elaborate plan to do so, including selecting a bank a couple of towns over with less foot traffic and locating a cabin in the woods to use as a safe house. They each get a tattoo on their ankles. Marmalade's is a heart with Baron's name in it, and Baron's is a jar of marmalade, intended to have her name on the label, however, the tattooist misspells it, missing the 'r', and so they alter it to say Mama instead, in honor of Eda. During this planning process, Baron notices that some of his mother's pills appear to have vanished. He also asks Marmalade to tell him why she no longer speaks to her biological mother. She initially avoids answering, but eventually reveals that she blames her biological mother for \"not saving [her]\" from one of her first foster fathers, whom she implies was sexually abusive and states he had a habit of locking his foster children in dog cages in his garage and prodding them with his white cane. She expresses that she wishes she'd killed him when she had the chance, and says that she's heard he still fosters kids. Baron comforts her, reminding her that she'd called him her \"knight in shining armor\" and her protector.Later, the two go to a store to purchase disguises for the heist. Marmalade selects two masks which Baron states they cannot afford, however, Marmalade pulls out a gun and pistol-whips the store's cashier. She attempts to rob the cash register, however is unable to open it and the pair flee. Baron, seemingly shaken from the incident, tells Marmalade that he has some baseball cards he can sell and they need not rob the bank, but she insists that they should do so the next day. That night, Eda has a coughing fit which Marmalade insists on attending to. When she screams, Baron rushes to help and finds his mother deceased in her bed. Marmalade insists she does not know what happened, and states that she left the room and then returned to find Eda dead.In the present day in prison, Otis extends his condolences to a teary-eyed Baron. He states that his mother has also been sick for his whole life, and that he is actually unsure whether or not she's alive. When Baron asks why they don't talk, Otis informs him that his mother lives in her childhood home of Kingston, Jamaica and that their \"shit is complicated\". Shortly after, they are summoned to the prison dining hall, where other inmates target Baron by stealing his food and pushing his face into his tray. Baron informs another inmate that he \"has something in his braid\", which prompts the other man to attempt to hit him. However, Otis intervenes and a riot breaks out in the dining hall. For his part in inciting it, Otis is handcuffed and escorted out of the room by a prison guard.Out of sight and earshot of the other inmates, it is revealed that Otis is not an incarcerated criminal at all. He is, in fact, an undercover FBI agent, working a case to catch a serial bank robber believed to be Marmalade. He was assigned as Baron's \"cellmate\" in hopes of manipulating him into revealing Marmalade's whereabouts so that she can finally be caught and arrested for her string of crimes. However, as Baron has not yet shared the location of he and Marmalade's meeting spot, Otis suggests that the investigative team allow him to stage a fake escape for the two of them, so that he will inadvertently lead the FBI directly to her. Although some other officers are hesitant about this, it is agreed that this plan will be put into operation. Otis returns to his and Baron's cell, where Baron continues telling his story.Upon his mother's passing, Baron once more attempts to back out of the robbery, as he had only ever agreed to it to afford her medication. However, Marmalade reveals that she is pregnant and insists they go ahead with the plan in order to establish a better life for themselves and their baby. Baron relents, although he refuses to go inside the bank and insists on only being the getaway driver. The next day, they carry out the heist and go to their safe house cabin. Baron expresses that they stole significantly more money than he anticipated and questions Marmalade on how she knows so much about banks and how to rob them. She reveals that she has robbed a number of banks in the past but that those occasions were always \"chump change\". She says that she had intended to quit robbing banks before meeting Baron, however decided to do one last job in order to start a good life with him. Baron becomes overwhelmed and leaves the room, however they quickly make up when Marmalade approaches him and reminds him that it's just the two of them (and, as an afterthought, their baby) \"against the whole wide world\". Later, she asks Baron to fetch the masks from the car so that they can burn them. While retrieving the masks, Baron finds a bottle of his mother's pills hidden in Marmalade's car, revealing that she is the one who took them and, consequentially, caused Eda's death. Enraged, Baron goes back into the cabin with the gun that Marmalade used to rob the bank and points it at her, demanding to know why she had the medication. She insists that she was \"holding onto them in case of an emergency\" and that she forgot that she had them in the car. During the confrontation, the police arrive and surround the cabin. Baron panics, insisting that they hand themselves over and apologise, but Marmalade instead convinces him to \"split the money and run\", and meet up with her again at 3:30 the following day at \"that spot [they] like\". Baron agrees and Marmalade flees. Baron hands himself over to the police as soon as she has left.In prison, Otis tells Baron that he will help him escape. Baron makes a phone call, ostensibly to Marmalade, where he tells her that he will meet her at the spot at 3:30 as arranged. They put their plan into motion the next day, with Otis disguising himself as a laundry attendant and Baron hiding inside a basket of towels and bedlinens. The plan is for both of them to leave under the guise of transporting dirty laundry out of the prison, however Otis is stopped by a guard who does not know he is an undercover agent. He wheels the basket containing Baron outside, but is apprehended himself until his fellow FBI officers intervene. Baron escapes in the designated getaway car, and Otis and the other FBI agents track him in a different vehicle. They follow him to a florist, where he purchases a bouquet and then to a cemetery where he leaves the flowers on what they believe to be his mother's grave. They then follow him to an ice cream shop, which Otis believes is likely to be his meeting spot with Marmalade, as the pair often ate ice cream together. When the getaway car pulls out of the parking lot, the FBI pursue. However, when they finally pull the car over, they discover the driver is not Baron or Marmalade, but an employee from the ice cream shop who reveals that Baron had told him he could keep the car if he drove it around the block and caused a distraction.Baron has driven back to the cabin in a different car that was visible in the ice cream shop parking lot. He retrieves the bag of money from inside the chimney, as well as newspaper clippings about the previous bank robberies, including one which reveals the FBI's involvement in solving them, featuring a picture of Otis as one of the agents on the case. Baron then goes to the bathroom and begins cutting his hair off in the mirror. He puts on a dress and a blonde wig and manages to escape town and evade capture disguised as a woman. Meanwhile Otis, releasing that Baron is not the bumbling idiot he seems to be, goes back to cemetery to investigate the grave that Baron had visited. He finds that it does not belong to Eda and that Baron did not leave a bouquet there, but a jar of marmalade with Mama written on the label - like his tattoo. Otis demands to see the security photos from the bank again and realizes that the bank robber has that very same tattoo. It is revealed that Marmalade never existed, and that this robbery (and the others) were carried out by Baron in drag.Out of town and in a new outfit, Baron walks into a pharmacy to collect a large order of Pleonexia, the medication he said was keeping his mother alive, under the name Lamram. The pharmacist states that Baron has bought out his whole supply, and Baron states that the medication is for his foster mom. He places a bottle in front of a mirror revealing that his foster mother's name - Eda Lamram - is 'marmalade' backwards.In pursuit of Baron, Otis and his coworkers trace the call he made from prison to a drug production company named Baron Pharmaceuticals (implying Baron is a pseudonym) and are confronted by the company CEO, Don Frankels, who reveals that the money stolen in the bank robbery was from his account. Otis notices that Frankels walks with a white cane and recalls the detail in Baron's story about \"Marmalade\" being abused by an early foster father. He asks Frankels if he fosters children, which he confirms that he does so that he can \"take a bunch of junkie rejects and turn 'em into something\". Otis has a team of officers investigate Frankels' home address, where they find three dog cages inside a garage and a jar of marmalade outside the door. Realising that this part of the story was true and Baron was likely one of the children abused, Otis has Frankels arrested. He finds a Moon Pie tucked into the wing mirror of his car and realises that it is another of Baron's calling cards, and that he must have been nearby recently. He goes to the nearby pharmacy, where the pharmacist reveals that Baron had purchased his pills and left, saying that he was going to buy tickets from the travel agent around the corner. There, Otis is given an envelope and informed that a man had been in shortly before and purchased tickets on his behalf. Inside the envelope, he finds a note from Baron which reads \"Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards. I'm taking care of my mother. I hope you'll do the same. Farewell, Secret Agent.\" as well as a first class plane ticket to Kingston, Jamaica to visit his mother.Baron pulls into a staff parking space at a nursing home. Upon entering, he approaches the front desk and is immediately recognised by the nurse working there, who hands over a clipboard and keys, revealing that he also works there. He goes room to room, dropping medication off for the residents, until he reaches the room labeled as Eda's. He also replenishes her medication, then enters the room, where he hands Eda a Moon Pie and the two of them stand and look out of the window together.",

He takes her home, and the two immediately fall into an intense whirlwind romance.With a lack of income to the home, Baron and Marmalade begin to brainstorm about ways to afford Eda's medication. He suggests that they should rent out the unused bedroom, but Marmalade convinces him that they should rob a bank instead. They construct an elaborate plan to do so, including selecting a bank a couple of towns over with less foot traffic and locating a cabin in the woods to use as a safe house. They each get a tattoo on their ankles. Marmalade's is a heart with Baron's name in it, and Baron's is a jar of marmalade, intended to have her name on the label, however, the tattooist misspells it, missing the 'r', and so they alter it to say Mama instead, in honor of Eda. During this planning process, Baron notices that some of his mother's pills appear to have vanished. He also asks Marmalade to tell him why she no longer speaks to her biological mother. She initially avoids answering, but eventually reveals that she blames her biological mother for \"not saving [her]\" from one of her first foster fathers, whom she implies was sexually abusive and states he had a habit of locking his foster children in dog cages in his garage and prodding them with his white cane. She expresses that she wishes she'd killed him when she had the chance, and says that she's heard he still fosters kids. Baron comforts her, reminding her that she'd called him her \"knight in shining armor\" and her protector.Later, the two go to a store to purchase disguises for the heist. Marmalade selects two masks which Baron states they cannot afford, however, Marmalade pulls out a gun and pistol-whips the store's cashier. She attempts to rob the cash register, however is unable to open it and the pair flee. Baron, seemingly shaken from the incident, tells Marmalade that he has some baseball cards he can sell and they need not rob the bank, but she insists that they should do so the next day. That night, Eda has a coughing fit which Marmalade insists on attending to. When she screams, Baron rushes to help and finds his mother deceased in her bed. Marmalade insists she does not know what happened, and states that she left the room and then returned to find Eda dead.In the present day in prison, Otis extends his condolences to a teary-eyed Baron. He states that his mother has also been sick for his whole life, and that he is actually unsure whether or not she's alive. When Baron asks why they don't talk, Otis informs him that his mother lives in her childhood home of Kingston, Jamaica and that their \"shit is complicated\". Shortly after, they are summoned to the prison dining hall, where other inmates target Baron by stealing his food and pushing his face into his tray. Baron informs another inmate that he \"has something in his braid\", which prompts the other man to attempt to hit him. However, Otis intervenes and a riot breaks out in the dining hall. For his part in inciting it, Otis is handcuffed and escorted out of the room by a prison guard.Out of sight and earshot of the other inmates, it is revealed that Otis is not an incarcerated criminal at all. He is, in fact, an undercover FBI agent, working a case to catch a serial bank robber believed to be Marmalade. He was assigned as Baron's \"cellmate\" in hopes of manipulating him into revealing Marmalade's whereabouts so that she can finally be caught and arrested for her string of crimes. However, as Baron has not yet shared the location of he and Marmalade's meeting spot, Otis suggests that the investigative team allow him to stage a fake escape for the two of them, so that he will inadvertently lead the FBI directly to her. Although some other officers are hesitant about this, it is agreed that this plan will be put into operation. Otis returns to his and Baron's cell, where Baron continues telling his story.Upon his mother's passing, Baron once more attempts to back out of the robbery, as he had only ever agreed to it to afford her medication. However, Marmalade reveals that she is pregnant and insists they go ahead with the plan in order to establish a better life for themselves and their baby. Baron relents, although he refuses to go inside the bank and insists on only being the getaway driver. The next day, they carry out the heist and go to their safe house cabin. Baron expresses that they stole significantly more money than he anticipated and questions Marmalade on how she knows so much about banks and how to rob them. She reveals that she has robbed a number of banks in the past but that those occasions were always \"chump change\". She says that she had intended to quit robbing banks before meeting Baron, however decided to do one last job in order to start a good life with him. Baron becomes overwhelmed and leaves the room, however they quickly make up when Marmalade approaches him and reminds him that it's just the two of them (and, as an afterthought, their baby) \"against the whole wide world\". Later, she asks Baron to fetch the masks from the car so that they can burn them. While retrieving the masks, Baron finds a bottle of his mother's pills hidden in Marmalade's car, revealing that she is the one who took them and, consequentially, caused Eda's death. Enraged, Baron goes back into the cabin with the gun that Marmalade used to rob the bank and points it at her, demanding to know why she had the medication. She insists that she was \"holding onto them in case of an emergency\" and that she forgot that she had them in the car. During the confrontation, the police arrive and surround the cabin. Baron panics, insisting that they hand themselves over and apologise, but Marmalade instead convinces him to \"split the money and run\", and meet up with her again at 3:30 the following day at \"that spot [they] like\". Baron agrees and Marmalade flees. Baron hands himself over to the police as soon as she has left.In prison, Otis tells Baron that he will help him escape. Baron makes a phone call, ostensibly to Marmalade, where he tells her that he will meet her at the spot at 3:30 as arranged. They put their plan into motion the next day, with Otis disguising himself as a laundry attendant and Baron hiding inside a basket of towels and bedlinens. The plan is for both of them to leave under the guise of transporting dirty laundry out of the prison, however Otis is stopped by a guard who does not know he is an undercover agent. He wheels the basket containing Baron outside, but is apprehended himself until his fellow FBI officers intervene. Baron escapes in the designated getaway car, and Otis and the other FBI agents track him in a different vehicle. They follow him to a florist, where he purchases a bouquet and then to a cemetery where he leaves the flowers on what they believe to be his mother's grave. They then follow him to an ice cream shop, which Otis believes is likely to be his meeting spot with Marmalade, as the pair often ate ice cream together. When the getaway car pulls out of the parking lot, the FBI pursue. However, when they finally pull the car over, they discover the driver is not Baron or Marmalade, but an employee from the ice cream shop who reveals that Baron had told him he could keep the car if he drove it around the block and caused a distraction.Baron has driven back to the cabin in a different car that was visible in the ice cream shop parking lot. He retrieves the bag of money from inside the chimney, as well as newspaper clippings about the previous bank robberies, including one which reveals the FBI's involvement in solving them, featuring a picture of Otis as one of the agents on the case. Baron then goes to the bathroom and begins cutting his hair off in the mirror. He puts on a dress and a blonde wig and manages to escape town and evade capture disguised as a woman. Meanwhile Otis, releasing that Baron is not the bumbling idiot he seems to be, goes back to cemetery to investigate the grave that Baron had visited. He finds that it does not belong to Eda and that Baron did not leave a bouquet there, but a jar of marmalade with Mama written on the label - like his tattoo. Otis demands to see the security photos from the bank again and realizes that the bank robber has that very same tattoo. It is revealed that Marmalade never existed, and that this robbery (and the others) were carried out by Baron in drag.Out of town and in a new outfit, Baron walks into a pharmacy to collect a large order of Pleonexia, the medication he said was keeping his mother alive, under the name Lamram. The pharmacist states that Baron has bought out his whole supply, and Baron states that the medication is for his foster mom. He places a bottle in front of a mirror revealing that his foster mother's name - Eda Lamram - is 'marmalade' backwards.In pursuit of Baron, Otis and his coworkers trace the call he made from prison to a drug production company named Baron Pharmaceuticals (implying Baron is a pseudonym) and are confronted by the company CEO, Don Frankels, who reveals that the money stolen in the bank robbery was from his account. Otis notices that Frankels walks with a white cane and recalls the detail in Baron's story about \"Marmalade\" being abused by an early foster father. He asks Frankels if he fosters children, which he confirms that he does so that he can \"take a bunch of junkie rejects and turn 'em into something\". Otis has a team of officers investigate Frankels' home address, where they find three dog cages inside a garage and a jar of marmalade outside the door. Realising that this part of the story was true and Baron was likely one of the children abused, Otis has Frankels arrested. He finds a Moon Pie tucked into the wing mirror of his car and realises that it is another of Baron's calling cards, and that he must have been nearby recently. He goes to the nearby pharmacy, where the pharmacist reveals that Baron had purchased his pills and left, saying that he was going to buy tickets from the travel agent around the corner. There, Otis is given an envelope and informed that a man had been in shortly before and purchased tickets on his behalf. Inside the envelope, he finds a note from Baron which reads \"Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards. I'm taking care of my mother. I hope you'll do the same. Farewell, Secret Agent.\" as well as a first class plane ticket to Kingston, Jamaica to visit his mother.Baron pulls into a staff parking space at a nursing home. Upon entering, he approaches the front desk and is immediately recognised by the nurse working there, who hands over a clipboard and keys, revealing that he also works there. He goes room to room, dropping medication off for the residents, until he reaches the room labeled as Eda's. He also replenishes her medication, then enters the room, where he hands Eda a Moon Pie and the two of them stand and look out of the window together.",
    "synopsis": "Baron (Keery), a sweet-natured but simple-minded small-town boy is incarcerated. Upon learning that his new cellmate, Otis (Hodge), has an extensive rap sheet including several prison breaks, Baron implores him to help him escape. He states that he needs to get out so that he can meet his girlfriend at an undisclosed spot the following afternoon. Otis is reluctant, stating that he doesn't trust anyone \"not even [his] own damn self\", however Baron promises him $250,000 cash if they are able to escape successfully. Otis agrees to carry out the prison break, but asks how Baron has that much money. Baron begins to tell the story of how he landed in prison.Some time prior to his arrest, Baron is let go from his job at the local post office, which he needs to support his terminally ill mother, Eda, due to his refusal to cut his long hair. Upon returning home, he finds a letter in the mailbox, stating that his mother's medication has increased in price. He informs her of this as he gives her her pills and feeds her a Moon Pie. Despondent, he goes to a local park, where he throws himself to the ground in frustration. A car, driven by an eccentric stranger with pink hair (Morrone), pulls up. The woman states that she thought she'd \"stumbled on a dead body\" and expresses disappointment that Baron is, in fact, alive. She asks Baron if there's anything to do in this \"shit town\", to which he responds that there isn't. She speeds away, but circles back when she sees him smashing a tree branch against the swing set. She teases him for \"flailing around like a puppet\", and he tells her that there are, in fact, things to do in town, including a quarry and an ice cream shop. She introduces herself as Marmalade, and asks him to show her around town.At the quarry, Marmalade and Baron exchange life stories. She tells him that she has been in the foster care system her entire life and he tells her about his mother's sickness. He also tells her that he grew up believing his father was an astronaut who was absent from his childhood because he was building a rocket and who died when said rocket exploded. Marmalade is amused by his naivety, and asks if she can stay with him that night. He takes her home, and the two immediately fall into an intense whirlwind romance.With a lack of income to the home, Baron and Marmalade begin to brainstorm about ways to afford Eda's medication.

    "summary": "The Hazelton Festival of Arts has gone through a few rough years, but Gabby, who is given the assignment to manage it this year by her boss Katrina, thinks that her novel idea of having acts of a professional paired with a local, amateur or professional, will give the show the needed kick-start to get it back on track. One of the acts she has already arranged is an aerial performance on the silks by her professional brother, Bennett, a former Olympic gymnast turned aerialist with an artistic circus troupe, his partner to be his regular partner Elise who qualifies as that local as living in Hazelton when they're not on the road. But when Bennett arrives back in town and announces that Elise has dropped out due to other commitments, Gabby is determined to find a local replacement, otherwise the act has to be dropped, the former option which doesn't sit well with Bennett who doesn't want to train someone else on such short notice. With the auditions having gone terribly, Gabby believes her friend Luna would be the perfect person. Luna, who came back to town to work for her family's construction company which was awarded the contract of any necessary construction work for the festival, is a former dancer, dancing which she doesn't like to let known still being her passion. As Bennett and Luna start working together, they butt heads in Bennett's doubts that they can put together a routine acceptable to him. But as they find the passion in their work, they become more confident that they can do more than a credible job as that passion transfers into their personal relationship. The question then becomes if there is a future for them as Bennett soon has to return to his regular work on the road.—Huggo",

But of all his fears, the thing he's the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark.

        "summary": "Baron (Keery), a sweet-natured but simple-minded small-town boy is incarcerated. Upon learning that his new cellmate, Otis (Hodge), has an extensive rap sheet including several prison breaks, Baron implores him to help him escape. He states that he needs to get out so that he can meet his girlfriend at an undisclosed spot the following afternoon. Otis is reluctant, stating that he doesn't trust anyone \"not even [his] own damn self\", however Baron promises him $250,000 cash if they are able to escape successfully. Otis agrees to carry out the prison break, but asks how Baron has that much money. Baron begins to tell the story of how he landed in prison.Some time prior to his arrest, Baron is let go from his job at the local post office, which he needs to support his terminally ill mother, Eda, due to his refusal to cut his long hair. Upon returning home, he finds a letter in the mailbox, stating that his mother's medication has increased in price. He informs her of this as he gives her her pills and feeds her a Moon Pie. Despondent, he goes to a local park, where he throws himself to the ground in frustration. A car, driven by an eccentric stranger with pink hair (Morrone), pulls up. The woman states that she thought she'd \"stumbled on a dead body\" and expresses disappointment that Baron is, in fact, alive. She asks Baron if there's anything to do in this \"shit town\", to which he responds that there isn't. She speeds away, but circles back when she sees him smashing a tree branch against the swing set. She teases him for \"flailing around like a puppet\", and he tells her that there are, in fact, things to do in town, including a quarry and an ice cream shop. She introduces herself as Marmalade, and asks him to show her around town.At the quarry, Marmalade and Baron exchange life stories. She tells him that she has been in the foster care system her entire life and he tells her about his mother's sickness. He also tells her that he grew up believing his father was an astronaut who was absent from his childhood because he was building a rocket and who died when said rocket exploded. Marmalade is amused by his naivety, and asks if she can stay with him that night. He takes her home, and the two immediately fall into an intense whirlwind romance.With a lack of income to the home, Baron and Marmalade begin to brainstorm about ways to afford Eda's medication. He suggests that they should rent out the unused bedroom, but Marmalade convinces him that they should rob a bank instead. They construct an elaborate plan to do so, including selecting a bank a couple of towns over with less foot traffic and locating a cabin in the woods to use as a safe house. They each get a tattoo on their ankles. Marmalade's is a heart with Baron's name in it, and Baron's is a jar of marmalade, intended to have her name on the label, however, the tattooist misspells it, missing the 'r', and so they alter it to say Mama instead, in honor of Eda. During this planning process, Baron notices that some of his mother's pills appear to have vanished. He also asks Marmalade to tell him why she no longer speaks to her biological mother. She initially avoids answering, but eventually reveals that she blames her biological mother for \"not saving [her]\" from one of her first foster fathers, whom she implies was sexually abusive and states he had a habit of locking his foster children in dog cages in his garage and prodding them with his white cane. She expresses that she wishes she'd killed him when she had the chance, and says that she's heard he still fosters kids. Baron comforts her, reminding her that she'd called him her \"knight in shining armor\" and her protector.Later, the two go to a store to purchase disguises for the heist. Marmalade selects two masks which Baron states they cannot afford, however, Marmalade pulls out a gun and pistol-whips the store's cashier. She attempts to rob the cash register, however is unable to open it and the pair flee. Baron, seemingly shaken from the incident, tells Marmalade that he has some baseball cards he can sell and they need not rob the bank, but she insists that they should do so the next day. That night, Eda has a coughing fit which Marmalade insists on attending to. When she screams, Baron rushes to help and finds his mother deceased in her bed. Marmalade insists she does not know what happened, and states that she left the room and then returned to find Eda dead.In the present day in prison, Otis extends his condolences to a teary-eyed Baron. He states that his mother has also been sick for his whole life, and that he is actually unsure whether or not she's alive. When Baron asks why they don't talk, Otis informs him that his mother lives in her childhood home of Kingston, Jamaica and that their \"shit is complicated\". Shortly after, they are summoned to the prison dining hall, where other inmates target Baron by stealing his food and pushing his face into his tray. Baron informs another inmate that he \"has something in his braid\", which prompts the other man to attempt to hit him. However, Otis intervenes and a riot breaks out in the dining hall. For his part in inciting it, Otis is handcuffed and escorted out of the room by a prison guard.Out of sight and earshot of the other inmates, it is revealed that Otis is not an incarcerated criminal at all. He is, in fact, an undercover FBI agent, working a case to catch a serial bank robber believed to be Marmalade. He was assigned as Baron's \"cellmate\" in hopes of manipulating him into revealing Marmalade's whereabouts so that she can finally be caught and arrested for her string of crimes. However, as Baron has not yet shared the location of he and Marmalade's meeting spot, Otis suggests that the investigative team allow him to stage a fake escape for the two of them, so that he will inadvertently lead the FBI directly to her. Although some other officers are hesitant about this, it is agreed that this plan will be put into operation. Otis returns to his and Baron's cell, where Baron continues telling his story.Upon his mother's passing, Baron once more attempts to back out of the robbery, as he had only ever agreed to it to afford her medication. However, Marmalade reveals that she is pregnant and insists they go ahead with the plan in order to establish a better life for themselves and their baby. Baron relents, although he refuses to go inside the bank and insists on only being the getaway driver. The next day, they carry out the heist and go to their safe house cabin. Baron expresses that they stole significantly more money than he anticipated and questions Marmalade on how she knows so much about banks and how to rob them. She reveals that she has robbed a number of banks in the past but that those occasions were always \"chump change\". She says that she had intended to quit robbing banks before meeting Baron, however decided to do one last job in order to start a good life with him. Baron becomes overwhelmed and leaves the room, however they quickly make up when Marmalade approaches him and reminds him that it's just the two of them (and, as an afterthought, their baby) \"against the whole wide world\". Later, she asks Baron to fetch the masks from the car so that they can burn them. While retrieving the masks, Baron finds a bottle of his mother's pills hidden in Marmalade's car, revealing that she is the one who took them and, consequentially, caused Eda's death. Enraged, Baron goes back into the cabin with the gun that Marmalade used to rob the bank and points it at her, demanding to know why she had the medication. She insists that she was \"holding onto them in case of an emergency\" and that she forgot that she had them in the car. During the confrontation, the police arrive and surround the cabin. Baron panics, insisting that they hand themselves over and apologise, but Marmalade instead convinces him to \"split the money and run\", and meet up with her again at 3:30 the following day at \"that spot [they] like\". Baron agrees and Marmalade flees. Baron hands himself over to the police as soon as she has left.In prison, Otis tells Baron that he will help him escape. Baron makes a phone call, ostensibly to Marmalade, where he tells her that he will meet her at the spot at 3:30 as arranged. They put their plan into motion the next day, with Otis disguising himself as a laundry attendant and Baron hiding inside a basket of towels and bedlinens. The plan is for both of them to leave under the guise of transporting dirty laundry out of the prison, however Otis is stopped by a guard who does not know he is an undercover agent. He wheels the basket containing Baron outside, but is apprehended himself until his fellow FBI officers intervene. Baron escapes in the designated getaway car, and Otis and the other FBI agents track him in a different vehicle. They follow him to a florist, where he purchases a bouquet and then to a cemetery where he leaves the flowers on what they believe to be his mother's grave. They then follow him to an ice cream shop, which Otis believes is likely to be his meeting spot with Marmalade, as the pair often ate ice cream together. When the getaway car pulls out of the parking lot, the FBI pursue. However, when they finally pull the car over, they discover the driver is not Baron or Marmalade, but an employee from the ice cream shop who reveals that Baron had told him he could keep the car if he drove it around the block and caused a distraction.Baron has driven back to the cabin in a different car that was visible in the ice cream shop parking lot. He retrieves the bag of money from inside the chimney, as well as newspaper clippings about the previous bank robberies, including one which reveals the FBI's involvement in solving them, featuring a picture of Otis as one of the agents on the case. Baron then goes to the bathroom and begins cutting his hair off in the mirror. He puts on a dress and a blonde wig and manages to escape town and evade capture disguised as a woman. Meanwhile Otis, releasing that Baron is not the bumbling idiot he seems to be, goes back to cemetery to investigate the grave that Baron had visited. He finds that it does not belong to Eda and that Baron did not leave a bouquet there, but a jar of marmalade with Mama written on the label - like his tattoo. Otis demands to see the security photos from the bank again and realizes that the bank robber has that very same tattoo. It is revealed that Marmalade never existed, and that this robbery (and the others) were carried out by Baron in drag.Out of town and in a new outfit, Baron walks into a pharmacy to collect a large order of Pleonexia, the medication he said was keeping his mother alive, under the name Lamram. The pharmacist states that Baron has bought out his whole supply, and Baron states that the medication is for his foster mom. He places a bottle in front of a mirror revealing that his foster mother's name - Eda Lamram - is 'marmalade' backwards.In pursuit of Baron, Otis and his coworkers trace the call he made from prison to a drug production company named Baron Pharmaceuticals (implying Baron is a pseudonym) and are confronted by the company CEO, Don Frankels, who reveals that the money stolen in the bank robbery was from his account. Otis notices that Frankels walks with a white cane and recalls the detail in Baron's story about \"Marmalade\" being abused by an early foster father. He asks Frankels if he fosters children, which he confirms that he does so that he can \"take a bunch of junkie rejects and turn 'em into something\". Otis has a team of officers investigate Frankels' home address, where they find three dog cages inside a garage and a jar of marmalade outside the door. Realising that this part of the story was true and Baron was likely one of the children abused, Otis has Frankels arrested. He finds a Moon Pie tucked into the wing mirror of his car and realises that it is another of Baron's calling cards, and that he must have been nearby recently. He goes to the nearby pharmacy, where the pharmacist reveals that Baron had purchased his pills and left, saying that he was going to buy tickets from the travel agent around the corner. There, Otis is given an envelope and informed that a man had been in shortly before and purchased tickets on his behalf. Inside the envelope, he finds a note from Baron which reads \"Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards. I'm taking care of my mother. I hope you'll do the same. Farewell, Secret Agent.\" as well as a first class plane ticket to Kingston, Jamaica to visit his mother.Baron pulls into a staff parking space at a nursing home. Upon entering, he approaches the front desk and is immediately recognised by the nurse working there, who hands over a clipboard and keys, revealing that he also works there. He goes room to room, dropping medication off for the residents, until he reaches the room labeled as Eda's. He also replenishes her medication, then enters the room, where he hands Eda a Moon Pie and the two of them stand and look out of the window together.",

Despondent, he goes to a local park, where he throws himself to the ground in frustration. A car, driven by an eccentric stranger with pink hair (Morrone), pulls up. The woman states that she thought she'd \"stumbled on a dead body\" and expresses disappointment that Baron is, in fact, alive. She asks Baron if there's anything to do in this \"shit town\", to which he responds that there isn't. She speeds away, but circles back when she sees him smashing a tree branch against the swing set. She teases him for \"flailing around like a puppet\", and he tells her that there are, in fact, things to do in town, including a quarry and an ice cream shop. She introduces herself as Marmalade, and asks him to show her around town.At the quarry, Marmalade and Baron exchange life stories. She tells him that she has been in the foster care system her entire life and he tells her about his mother's sickness. He also tells her that he grew up believing his father was an astronaut who was absent from his childhood because he was building a rocket and who died when said rocket exploded. Marmalade is amused by his naivety, and asks if she can stay with him that night. He takes her home, and the two immediately fall into an intense whirlwind romance.With a lack of income to the home, Baron and Marmalade begin to brainstorm about ways to afford Eda's medication. He suggests that they should rent out the unused bedroom, but Marmalade convinces him that they should rob a bank instead. They construct an elaborate plan to do so, including selecting a bank a couple of towns over with less foot traffic and locating a cabin in the woods to use as a safe house. They each get a tattoo on their ankles. Marmalade's is a heart with Baron's name in it, and Baron's is a jar of marmalade, intended to have her name on the label, however, the tattooist misspells it, missing the 'r', and so they alter it to say Mama instead, in honor of Eda. During this planning process, Baron notices that some of his mother's pills appear to have vanished. He also asks Marmalade to tell him why she no longer speaks to her biological mother. She initially avoids answering, but eventually reveals that she blames her biological mother for \"not saving [her]\" from one of her first foster fathers, whom she implies was sexually abusive and states he had a habit of locking his foster children in dog cages in his garage and prodding them with his white cane. She expresses that she wishes she'd killed him when she had the chance, and says that she's heard he still fosters kids. Baron comforts her, reminding her that she'd called him her \"knight in shining armor\" and her protector.Later, the two go to a store to purchase disguises for the heist. Marmalade selects two masks which Baron states they cannot afford, however, Marmalade pulls out a gun and pistol-whips the store's cashier. She attempts to rob the cash register, however is unable to open it and the pair flee. Baron, seemingly shaken from the incident, tells Marmalade that he has some baseball cards he can sell and they need not rob the bank, but she insists that they should do so the next day. That night, Eda has a coughing fit which Marmalade insists on attending to. When she screams, Baron rushes to help and finds his mother deceased in her bed. Marmalade insists she does not know what happened, and states that she left the room and then returned to find Eda dead.In the present day in prison, Otis extends his condolences to a teary-eyed Baron. He states that his mother has also been sick for his whole life, and that he is actually unsure whether or not she's alive. When Baron asks why they don't talk, Otis informs him that his mother lives in her childhood home of Kingston, Jamaica and that their \"shit is complicated\". Shortly after, they are summoned to the prison dining hall, where other inmates target Baron by stealing his food and pushing his face into his tray. Baron informs another inmate that he \"has something in his braid\", which prompts the other man to attempt to hit him. However, Otis intervenes and a riot breaks out in the dining hall. For his part in inciting it, Otis is handcuffed and escorted out of the room by a prison guard.Out of sight and earshot of the other inmates, it is revealed that Otis is not an incarcerated criminal at all. He is, in fact, an undercover FBI agent, working a case to catch a serial bank robber believed to be Marmalade. He was assigned as Baron's \"cellmate\" in hopes of manipulating him into revealing Marmalade's whereabouts so that she can finally be caught and arrested for her string of crimes. However, as Baron has not yet shared the location of he and Marmalade's meeting spot, Otis suggests that the investigative team allow him to stage a fake escape for the two of them, so that he will inadvertently lead the FBI directly to her. Although some other officers are hesitant about this, it is agreed that this plan will be put into operation. Otis returns to his and Baron's cell, where Baron continues telling his story.Upon his mother's passing, Baron once more attempts to back out of the robbery, as he had only ever agreed to it to afford her medication. However, Marmalade reveals that she is pregnant and insists they go ahead with the plan in order to establish a better life for themselves and their baby. Baron relents, although he refuses to go inside the bank and insists on only being the getaway driver. The next day, they carry out the heist and go to their safe house cabin. Baron expresses that they stole significantly more money than he anticipated and questions Marmalade on how she knows so much about banks and how to rob them. She reveals that she has robbed a number of banks in the past but that those occasions were always \"chump change\". She says that she had intended to quit robbing banks before meeting Baron, however decided to do one last job in order to start a good life with him. Baron becomes overwhelmed and leaves the room, however they quickly make up when Marmalade approaches him and reminds him that it's just the two of them (and, as an afterthought, their baby) \"against the whole wide world\". Later, she asks Baron to fetch the masks from the car so that they can burn them. While retrieving the masks, Baron finds a bottle of his mother's pills hidden in Marmalade's car, revealing that she is the one who took them and, consequentially, caused Eda's death. Enraged, Baron goes back into the cabin with the gun that Marmalade used to rob the bank and points it at her, demanding to know why she had the medication. She insists that she was \"holding onto them in case of an emergency\" and that she forgot that she had them in the car. During the confrontation, the police arrive and surround the cabin. Baron panics, insisting that they hand themselves over and apologise, but Marmalade instead convinces him to \"split the money and run\", and meet up with her again at 3:30 the following day at \"that spot [they] like\". Baron agrees and Marmalade flees. Baron hands himself over to the police as soon as she has left.In prison, Otis tells Baron that he will help him escape. Baron makes a phone call, ostensibly to Marmalade, where he tells her that he will meet her at the spot at 3:30 as arranged. They put their plan into motion the next day, with Otis disguising himself as a laundry attendant and Baron hiding inside a basket of towels and bedlinens. The plan is for both of them to leave under the guise of transporting dirty laundry out of the prison, however Otis is stopped by a guard who does not know he is an undercover agent. He wheels the basket containing Baron outside, but is apprehended himself until his fellow FBI officers intervene. Baron escapes in the designated getaway car, and Otis and the other FBI agents track him in a different vehicle. They follow him to a florist, where he purchases a bouquet and then to a cemetery where he leaves the flowers on what they believe to be his mother's grave. They then follow him to an ice cream shop, which Otis believes is likely to be his meeting spot with Marmalade, as the pair often ate ice cream together. When the getaway car pulls out of the parking lot, the FBI pursue. However, when they finally pull the car over, they discover the driver is not Baron or Marmalade, but an employee from the ice cream shop who reveals that Baron had told him he could keep the car if he drove it around the block and caused a distraction.Baron has driven back to the cabin in a different car that was visible in the ice cream shop parking lot. He retrieves the bag of money from inside the chimney, as well as newspaper clippings about the previous bank robberies, including one which reveals the FBI's involvement in solving them, featuring a picture of Otis as one of the agents on the case. Baron then goes to the bathroom and begins cutting his hair off in the mirror. He puts on a dress and a blonde wig and manages to escape town and evade capture disguised as a woman. Meanwhile Otis, releasing that Baron is not the bumbling idiot he seems to be, goes back to cemetery to investigate the grave that Baron had visited. He finds that it does not belong to Eda and that Baron did not leave a bouquet there, but a jar of marmalade with Mama written on the label - like his tattoo. Otis demands to see the security photos from the bank again and realizes that the bank robber has that very same tattoo. It is revealed that Marmalade never existed, and that this robbery (and the others) were carried out by Baron in drag.Out of town and in a new outfit, Baron walks into a pharmacy to collect a large order of Pleonexia, the medication he said was keeping his mother alive, under the name Lamram. The pharmacist states that Baron has bought out his whole supply, and Baron states that the medication is for his foster mom. He places a bottle in front of a mirror revealing that his foster mother's name - Eda Lamram - is 'marmalade' backwards.In pursuit of Baron, Otis and his coworkers trace the call he made from prison to a drug production company named Baron Pharmaceuticals (implying Baron is a pseudonym) and are confronted by the company CEO, Don Frankels, who reveals that the money stolen in the bank robbery was from his account. Otis notices that Frankels walks with a white cane and recalls the detail in Baron's story about \"Marmalade\" being abused by an early foster father. He asks Frankels if he fosters children, which he confirms that he does so that he can \"take a bunch of junkie rejects and turn 'em into something\". Otis has a team of officers investigate Frankels' home address, where they find three dog cages inside a garage and a jar of marmalade outside the door. Realising that this part of the story was true and Baron was likely one of the children abused, Otis has Frankels arrested. He finds a Moon Pie tucked into the wing mirror of his car and realises that it is another of Baron's calling cards, and that he must have been nearby recently. He goes to the nearby pharmacy, where the pharmacist reveals that Baron had purchased his pills and left, saying that he was going to buy tickets from the travel agent around the corner. There, Otis is given an envelope and informed that a man had been in shortly before and purchased tickets on his behalf. Inside the envelope, he finds a note from Baron which reads \"Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards. I'm taking care of my mother. I hope you'll do the same. Farewell, Secret Agent.\" as well as a first class plane ticket to Kingston, Jamaica to visit his mother.Baron pulls into a staff parking space at a nursing home. Upon entering, he approaches the front desk and is immediately recognised by the nurse working there, who hands over a clipboard and keys, revealing that he also works there. He goes room to room, dropping medication off for the residents, until he reaches the room labeled as Eda's. He also replenishes her medication, then enters the room, where he hands Eda a Moon Pie and the two of them stand and look out of the window together.",
        "synopsis": "Baron (Keery), a sweet-natured but simple-minded small-town boy is incarcerated. Upon learning that his new cellmate, Otis (Hodge), has an extensive rap sheet including several prison breaks, Baron implores him to help him escape. He states that he needs to get out so that he can meet his girlfriend at an undisclosed spot the following afternoon. Otis is reluctant, stating that he doesn't trust anyone \"not even [his] own damn self\", however Baron promises him $250,000 cash if they are able to escape successfully. Otis agrees to carry out the prison break, but asks how Baron has that much money. Baron begins to tell the story of how he landed in prison.Some time prior to his arrest, Baron is let go from his job at the local post office, which he needs to support his terminally ill mother, Eda, due to his refusal to cut his long hair.

She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial \"Mr. Darcy\", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore. Part of what Lilly loves about Jane, beyond the romantic nature of her novels, is that she has an answer for most of life's problems. So in wanting Jane to provide her answers to her life's problems, Lilly is nonetheless surprised when the spirit of Jane enters her life. While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.—Huggo",

While Jane has to update her two hundred year old thoughts to Lilly's twenty-first century world, Lilly has to deal with the agency's newest client, Trevor Fitzsimmons, the rude bookstore clerk who is really its new owner and a tech giant who wants to market the bookstore to link to his online world, which is somewhat against Lilly's sensibilities.—Huggo",
        "synopsis": "Lilly Thorpe is in a rut and at a crossroads in her life. She works as a copywriter at a Boston ad agency, a job she doesn't much like, especially in that her dream would be to finish her novel on which she's long stopped working. The president of the Jane Society, as in Jane Austen, she has been informed by Mr. Whitcomb, the owner of the English pub where they hold their meetings for free, that he is retiring and thus selling, meaning that she has to find somewhere else appropriate to hold their meetings at an affordable price. She has long talked about going to England to do a Jane tour, but one thing or another has always stopped her. And while she would like to find her proverbial \"Mr. Darcy\", she doesn't want him to be her savior, she turning down the marriage proposal of her current boyfriend Martin, he offering her a life in Chicago as that savior. Her friend and coworker Alisha, who is having her own man problems in feeling pressured by her family to get married despite not having that man, believes their coworker Brennan is interested in Lilly, he being someone that Lilly would not even entertain as a romantic partner, while the latest man to enter her life is the rude new clerk at her favorite local bookstore.

With Betty, she has a history of pulling away from any boyfriend on the slightest hint of any harm coming to him. Betty believes the stars already have it in for her when she is attracted to her new neighbor Alex in he going into the world's danger zones as a photojournalist. Beyond his job, Alex is a risk taker in wanting to live life to the fullest. As they spend more time together, Betty has to decide what to do in really liking him but not wanting to see any harm come to him.—Huggo",

After the attack, Dan contacts his former associate, Augie, to find out why he was attacked and Augie suggests it is Dan's former employer McCaffrey, and advises him to disappear just to be safe. Dan orders a new set of identity documents for him and his family. Dan retrieves his kids from school and picks Jessica up from work, telling her they're taking a spontaneous road trip to Las Vegas.As they're leaving town, Dan realized that they're being followed and deduces that their family minivan has a tracker planted on it. He stops at his car dealership and uses one of the service bays to find and remove the device from the undercarriage.Meanwhile, McCaffrey and his team go through the Morgans' home but can't find any indication where they're headed as Dan discarded everyone's cell phones to avoid being traced. He drives through the night until they reach Iowa City. Excited, Nina begs them to check out the Southern Iowa University because she hopes to follow her boyfriend Trevor there rather than pursue her original goal of attending Stanford.During a campus tour, Dan notices a German man on his phone, and believes he works for McCaffrey, though he realizes he's mistaken when they're attacked by another of McCaffrey's henchmen, battling it out in one of the chemistry labs before incapacitating the man and rejoining his family on the tour. Before leaving campus, Nina manages to find Trevor's dorm only to learn he's cheating on her with another girl. When she finds out that Trevor is cheating on her, Dan teaches her some martial arts moves, which she uses on the former.As they head to Vegas, Dan grows closer to his family. They arrive in Las Vegas, where Dan plans to tell Jessica the truth about his past over a romantic dinner. While they leave the kids to babysit Max in their penthouse suite, the kids take off with Max to walk to the Strip. When Dan and Jessica head back to their suite to check on the kids, they are attacked by McCaffrey's team. Dan quickly dispatches them, shocking Jessica. Revealing his name to be Sean, he finally comes clean to his family, who are outraged. Sean nevertheless gives them their new passports and IDs, telling them that their lives in Buffalo are over. The next morning, Jessica's friend, Gwen, arrives in a private jet to fly them home to Buffalo.On the plane, Gwen reveals she works for McCaffrey and hands Jessica and the kids over to him. He takes them hostage, and threatens to kill them unless Sean accepts his offer. He relents, and Jessica and the kids are taken back to the airport to leave for Buffalo. Sean manages to escape and McCaffrey calls his army into the lobby of the hotel to recapture him. Sean engages the mercenaries while Jessica and the kids fight Gwen, culminating in Jessica using a piece of broken bamboo as a javelin to impale Gwen through the chest. Meanwhile, Sean knocks McCaffrey out.Some time later, the Morgans have returned to their lives in Buffalo; Sean / Dan is now running his own security firm using his skillset to advise clients how to better defend against attacks while Jessica coaches high school track and field.Returning home, they load up into a rented RV embarking on a cross-country roadtrip to drop Nina off at Stanford.",

        "summary": "During Thanksgiving in Plymouth, Massachusetts, people are gathering outside the local RightMart superstore in preparation for a Black Friday sale. Jessica Wright, whose father Thomas owns the store, lets her boyfriend Bobby and her friends Evan, Gaby, Scuba, and Yulia inside the store early through a side door. The crowd especially Lonnie seeing this instigates a riot and, in a frenzy, stampedes into the store, resulting in multiple people dying, including Amanda Collins, the wife of store manager Mitch. Bobby gets his arm broken when he tries to rescue one of the security guards trapped under the doors while being trampled on and subsequently disappears from the group.One year later, RightMart is preparing for another Black Friday sale, despite the protests of Mitch and several other residents. Meanwhile, Jessica and her friends are tagged in a social media post of a Thanksgiving table with their names around it. Bobby, who has broken up with Jessica, returns to Plymouth to work for his uncle after being injured in the riot, much to the chagrin of Jessica's current boyfriend Ryan. A waitress named Lizzie is attacked and killed by a figure dressed in black clothing wearing a John Carver mask. The police discover that Lizzie was present at the Black Friday incident, which leads them to believe those involved in the massacre are being targeted by Carver.Jessica aids the investigation by providing footage of the riot to the town's sheriff, Eric Newlon. Carver rampages through Plymouth and kills several residents, including RightMart security guard Manny and high school students Amy and Lonnie. Evan and Gaby are soon abducted by Carver, while Jessica narrowly avoids being killed. Yulia's father decides to move their family to Florida, but he and the deputy sheriff guarding them are knocked out by Carver before he attacks Yulia. Jessica and Scuba drive to Yulia's house, but are unable to stop Carver from disemboweling Yulia with a buzz saw before he escapes.The police attempt to lure Carver out by having the Wright family and Scuba participate in a Thanksgiving parade, disguised as Pilgrims. However, Carver deduces their plan and decapitates a turkey mascot before sending smoke bombs into the crowd, causing everyone to scatter in panic and giving Carver the opportunity to abduct the Wrights and Scuba in the chaos. Carver then cooks Jessica's stepmother Kathleen alive in an oven before serving her as the \"turkey\" at a dinner table surrounded by his hostages and his victims' corpses. Carver then bludgeons Evan to death in a live-stream before Jessica cuts through her bindings and escapes, luring him away from the others. She eludes Carver by climbing over a fence and running through the woods. Jessica makes it to a parade warehouse, and finds Newlon unconscious. When she follows a figure wearing Carver's mask inside, she sees it is Bobby. She calls Newlon to help capture Bobby, but he escapes.The police soon arrive and inform them that the survivors are safe. Once they leave Jessica and Newlon alone, Jessica notices the same bramble debris from the fence and the deep woods that stuck to her are also on Newlon's clothing and sneakers, realizing he is the killer. Newlon reveals that he was having an affair with Amanda, who was pregnant with his child before she died. This was his motive to become Carver and seek revenge on those responsible. Newlon had abducted Bobby and put him in the Carver costume, intending to shoot Bobby and frame him for the murders. To Newlon's horror, it is revealed that Jessica has live streamed his confession, leading him to attack her until she is saved by Bobby.As they attempt to escape in a tow truck belonging to Bobby's uncle, Newlon hooks it to a support beam and approaches them with an axe. Jessica uses a musket to shoot a turkey parade balloon that was attached to a tank of flammable gas, causing an explosion that engulfs Newlon in flames. The following morning, Bobby is taken away in an ambulance and Jessica reunites with Ryan, Gaby, and Scuba. The authorities are unable to find Newlon's remains, leading them to believe he was incinerated in the explosion. However, Jessica continues to have nightmares of a flaming Newlon attacking her.",

Jessica Wright, whose father Thomas owns the store, lets her boyfriend Bobby and her friends Evan, Gaby, Scuba, and Yulia inside the store early through a side door. The crowd especially Lonnie seeing this instigates a riot and, in a frenzy, stampedes into the store, resulting in multiple people dying, including Amanda Collins, the wife of store manager Mitch. Bobby gets his arm broken when he tries to rescue one of the security guards trapped under the doors while being trampled on and subsequently disappears from the group.One year later, RightMart is preparing for another Black Friday sale, despite the protests of Mitch and several other residents. Meanwhile, Jessica and her friends are tagged in a social media post of a Thanksgiving table with their names around it. Bobby, who has broken up with Jessica, returns to Plymouth to work for his uncle after being injured in the riot, much to the chagrin of Jessica's current boyfriend Ryan. A waitress named Lizzie is attacked and killed by a figure dressed in black clothing wearing a John Carver mask. The police discover that Lizzie was present at the Black Friday incident, which leads them to believe those involved in the massacre are being targeted by Carver.Jessica aids the investigation by providing footage of the riot to the town's sheriff, Eric Newlon. Carver rampages through Plymouth and kills several residents, including RightMart security guard Manny and high school students Amy and Lonnie. Evan and Gaby are soon abducted by Carver, while Jessica narrowly avoids being killed. Yulia's father decides to move their family to Florida, but he and the deputy sheriff guarding them are knocked out by Carver before he attacks Yulia. Jessica and Scuba drive to Yulia's house, but are unable to stop Carver from disemboweling Yulia with a buzz saw before he escapes.The police attempt to lure Carver out by having the Wright family and Scuba participate in a Thanksgiving parade, disguised as Pilgrims. However, Carver deduces their plan and decapitates a turkey mascot before sending smoke bombs into the crowd, causing everyone to scatter in panic and giving Carver the opportunity to abduct the Wrights and Scuba in the chaos. Carver then cooks Jessica's stepmother Kathleen alive in an oven before serving her as the \"turkey\" at a dinner table surrounded by his hostages and his victims' corpses. Carver then bludgeons Evan to death in a live-stream before Jessica cuts through her bindings and escapes, luring him away from the others. She eludes Carver by climbing over a fence and running through the woods. Jessica makes it to a parade warehouse, and finds Newlon unconscious. When she follows a figure wearing Carver's mask inside, she sees it is Bobby. She calls Newlon to help capture Bobby, but he escapes.The police soon arrive and inform them that the survivors are safe. Once they leave Jessica and Newlon alone, Jessica notices the same bramble debris from the fence and the deep woods that stuck to her are also on Newlon's clothing and sneakers, realizing he is the killer. Newlon reveals that he was having an affair with Amanda, who was pregnant with his child before she died. This was his motive to become Carver and seek revenge on those responsible. Newlon had abducted Bobby and put him in the Carver costume, intending to shoot Bobby and frame him for the murders. To Newlon's horror, it is revealed that Jessica has live streamed his confession, leading him to attack her until she is saved by Bobby.As they attempt to escape in a tow truck belonging to Bobby's uncle, Newlon hooks it to a support beam and approaches them with an axe. Jessica uses a musket to shoot a turkey parade balloon that was attached to a tank of flammable gas, causing an explosion that engulfs Newlon in flames. The following morning, Bobby is taken away in an ambulance and Jessica reunites with Ryan, Gaby, and Scuba. The authorities are unable to find Newlon's remains, leading them to believe he was incinerated in the explosion. However, Jessica continues to have nightmares of a flaming Newlon attacking her.",
